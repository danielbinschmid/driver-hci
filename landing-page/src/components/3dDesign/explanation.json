        "paragraph": "We wanted to integrate our approach seemlessly into existing car interiors without adding too much new hardware. Our solution only appends a small camera to the existing rearview mirror. The camera is used for handgesture recognition to enable the user to actively take decision and interact with the ADS."

        "paragraph": "We also thought about edge cases, where handgesture recognition might night work. One example is bad lighting. For this case we came up with the idea of implementing a hardware-based haptile user interface as backup. It may be realised as two physical buttons mounted on the center console or something similar."
